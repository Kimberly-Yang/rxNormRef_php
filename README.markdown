RxNormRef
=========
**Ronaldo Barbachano**

**Aug. 2010**


A tool to access the NIH's database of semantic medical terms. Uses the rxNorm_php api library maintained by Code For America.

Features 
========

**100% Object Oriented**

**Low Memory Use - usually well under 1 meg.**

**Fast Record Loading - around .2 to .5 seconds for most queries.**

**Progressive Loading - Creates a buffer that refreshes to screen in a rapid fashion as data is processed.**

**Query Caching - Can store html data generated by queries, to retrieve instead of hitting the API**

**Dependencies**
***PHP5***
***Curl***

Why So Fast?
============
RxNormRef uses PHP5's new SimpleXMLElement. While RxNormRef does offer its data in JSON format, I decided to format data from XML
for compatibility/portability reasons.

How to Install/Use
================== 
Upload to web server, call rxNormRef.php (can also optionally be named to index.php).
